[00:00.94]I might lose my mind
[00:03.70]Waking when the sun's down
[00:06.30]Riding all these highs
[00:08.70]Waiting for the comedown
[00:11.30]Walk these streets with me
[00:13.73]I'm doing decently
[00:16.13]Just glad that I can breathe, yeah
[00:20.09]I'm trying to realize
[00:24.65]It's alright to not be fine on your own
[00:35.32]Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee
[00:40.37]These last few weeks have been exhausting
[00:45.43]I'm lost in my imagination
[00:50.46]And there's one thing that I need from you
[00:54.49]Can you come through, through
[01:06.19]Through, yeah
[01:11.05]And there's one thing that I need from you
[01:15.47]Can you come through?
[01:17.62]Staring at the ceiling
[01:22.48]I'm wishing for the sky
[01:26.75]I don't know what I'm feeling
[01:30.43]Maybe I'm just needing
[01:33.06]Someone to pass the time
[01:36.24]I'm trying to realize
[01:41.12]It's alright to not be fine on your own
[01:52.02]Now I'm shaking, drinking all this coffee
[01:57.07]These last few weeks have been exhausting
[02:02.32]I'm lost in my imagination
[02:07.13]And there's one thing that I need from you
[02:11.29]Can you come through (Can you come through)
[02:16.87]Through (Can you come through, oh)
[02:22.78]Through, yeah
[02:27.74]And there's one thing that I need from you
[02:31.79]Can you come through, through
[02:43.21]Through, yeah
[02:48.17]And there's one thing that I need from you
[02:52.58]Can you come through?
